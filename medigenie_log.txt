Slight swelling of the pancreas indicates mild illness. Significant swelling, especially with evidence of destruction of the pancreas and/or fluid build-up in the abdominal cavity, indicates more severe illness. With severe illness, there is a worse prognosis. Prevention Alcoholism is essentially the only preventable cause of pancreatitis. Patients with chronic pancreatitis must stop drinking alcohol entirely. The drugs that cause or may cause pancreatitis should also be avoided.

Rosalyn Carson-DeWitt, MD Panic attack see Panic disorder Panic disorder Definition A panic attack is a sudden, intense experience of fear coupled with an overwhelming feeling of danger, accompanied by physical symptoms of anxiety, such as a pounding heart, sweating, and rapid breathing. A person with panic disorder may have repeated panic attacks (at least several a month) and feel severeanxi- ety about having another attack. Description Each year, panic disorder affects one out of 63 Americans. While many people experience moments of anxiety, panic attacks are sudden and unprovoked, having little to do with real danger. Panic disorder is a chronic, debilitating condition that can have a devastating impact on a person’s family, work, and social life. Typically, the first attack strikes without warning. A person might be walking down the street, driving a car, or riding an escalator when suddenly panic strikes. Pounding heart, sweat- ing palms, and an overwhelming feeling of impending doom are common features. While the attack may last only seconds or minutes, the experience can be pro- foundly disturbing. A person who has had one panic attack typically worries that another one may occur at any time. As the fear of future panic attacks deepens, the person begins to avoid situations in which panic occurred in the past. In severe cases of panic disorder, the victim refuses to leave the house for fear of having a panic attack. This fear of being in exposed places is often calledagoraphobia. People with untreated panic disorder may have problems getting to work or staying on the job. As the person’s world narrows, untreated panic disorder can lead to depression, substance abuse, and in rare instances, suicide. Causes and symptoms Scientists are not sure what causes panic disorder, but they suspect the tendency to develop the condition can be inherited. Some experts think that people with panic disorder may have a hypersensitive nervous system that unnecessarily responds to nonexistent threats. Research suggests that people with panic disorder may not be able to make proper use of their body’s normal stress-reducing chemicals. People with panic disorder usually have their first panic attack in their 20s. Four or more of the following symptoms during panic attacks would indicate panic disorder if no medical, drug-related, neurologic, or other psychiatric disorder is found: /C15pounding, skipping or palpitating heartbeat /C15shortness of breath or the sensation of smothering /C15dizziness or lightheadedness /C15nausea or stomach problems /C15chest pains or pressure /C15choking sensation or a ‘‘lump in the throat’’ /C15chills or hot flashes /C15sweating /C15fear of dying /C15feelings of unreality or being detached /C15tingling ornumbness /C15shaking and trembling /C15fear of losing control or going crazy A panic attack is often accompanied by the urge to escape, together with a feeling of certainty that death is imminent. Others are convinced they are about to have aheart attack, suffocate, lose control, 2778 GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Panic disorder
